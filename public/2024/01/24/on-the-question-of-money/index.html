                    <p>The OCRS has always been a project that I worked on for the sheer joy of it - and that has benefits and problems.</p>
<p>The benefit is that when I work, I work with passion and enthusiasm, I go above and beyond to make things work well, to create something that&rsquo;s both useful and pleasant. But that enthusiasm isn&rsquo;t unlimited - eventually I burn out and need to step away. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s no financial support to create or maintain the site and its resources - it&rsquo;s all on me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with a couple of approaches to generating income - the most recent of these was to introduce Google Ads to the <a href="https://www.understandingreligion.org.uk/">Understanding Religion</a> website, which receives a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>I resisted the introduction of adverts to the OCRS for years on principle, not wanting to damage the pure experience that we offered. But, in an effort to make the project more financially independent, I thought that it was worth trialling. In short, <strong>it was not</strong>.</p>
<p>I felt conflicted about the impact on user experience, the data that would be collected via cookies, and the damage to the overall aesthetic - ads rarely look pleasant, and more often than not spoil the appearance of a website.</p>
<p>And I could perhaps have justified these issues if the website had suddenly started to generate significant income - but in reality, despite the thousands of visitors we have, it was hardly anything at all, less than Â£25, even several months into the trial. Not exactly earth shaking - and in fact less than the threshold for Google to even pay the balance!</p>
<p>So I had sold out my ideals for nothing&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now taken the adverts down from the site, and will continue to keep the lights on, but life often gets in the way of updates. Before Elon destroyed Twitter I used to keep up with developments in the field among academics and educators, but since it all went a bit peculiar and transformed into X I dropped off and have rarely gone back. That means that I&rsquo;ve also lost touch with the latest thoughts and discussions in the field, and at the same time my day job has become more involved, my family has grown, and the OCRS has necessarily fallen into (minor) disrepair.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re here, hello! <strong>You might be able to help.</strong> New articles on the Understanding Religion site, new blog posts, new online courses, new links to external resources - all these things help to keep the OCRS alive.</p>
<p>When it comes to the question of money, if you know of any funding, or any organisations open to partnership - particularly training providers like universities and colleges - then let me know! I would love for this site to continue to grow, but to be frank I can&rsquo;t keep up with my ambitions here <em>and</em> work a full time job elsewhere. I know this is often the way when it comes to side projects and part time endeavours, but if more people are involved then perhaps we can avoid those pitfalls.</p>
<p>As ever, if you want to get in touch, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hello@ocrs.online">hello@ocrs.online</a> ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>All the best</p>
<p>Luke</p>
